        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Happy New Year! One of my resolutions for 2026 is to do more public writing. Predictably, I'm starting a Substack and created a personal website (nahuelfefer.com) to share my work and ideas more broadly.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I'm worried that this will feel a lot like screaming into the void—into a flood of information and misinformation that's drowning democracy, dividing communities, and eroding our collective memory. But my hope is that at worst, my writing will do no harm, and at best, it may contribute to some progress.</p>

            <h2>Staying Connected to St. Louis</h2>

            <p>I miss St. Louis, and I've been struggling to figure out how to stay involved from a distance. While I'm glad to be working with the City Law Department, I miss my day to day interactions with my friends and the community which I served for nearly a decade. I have a lot of ideas about how to recreate some of that engagement digitally, but for now, I want to start by simply inviting St. Louisans to explore my work in a more accessible way than ever before.</p>

            <p>I'm also doing this because I feel an obligation to share what I've learned from seven years at the heart of city government under four mayors. That's why I'm finally publishing <strong>Common Sense Charter Reform for St. Louis</strong> and <strong>Equitable Unification</strong>, along with a forthcoming article on taxes, incentives, and economic justice. My hope is that these reports can be of some use to those of you on the ground working for change.</p>

            <p>St. Louis is a heartbreaking city. But despite its dysfunctions, it is also a great city, and I believe that if we can break down the silos that define the region and build better mechanisms for collective action, it can grow and thrive once again. If you're interested in working towards some of these overdue reforms—or just want to stay connected—please sign up for my Substack.</p>

            <h2>The Bigger Picture: Upgrading Democracy</h2>

            <p>These problems—dysfunctional political and economic systems—are bigger than St. Louis. Our basic mechanisms for collective action—capitalist markets and democratic elections—are profoundly broken.</p>

            <p>Elections and markets are both valuation mechanisms designed to aggregate individual preferences into social choices, and both are failing. Markets are unjust, democracy is unresponsive, and neither reflects public values.</p>

            <p>I think we are where we are today—in the midst of a constitutional crisis characterized by an imperial presidency, gridlocked Congress, and captured courts—because capitalism has largely consumed democracy as tax cuts for the rich redistribute trillions in wealth and Supreme Court decisions like <em>Citizens United</em> translate the principle of "one person, one vote" into "one dollar, one vote." The slow awakening of otherwise apolitical Americans to the death of the American Dream has unleashed an existential fear of poverty, driving millions into the arms of a populist autocrat.</p>

            <p>But why did capitalism consume democracy? Part of the answer lies in our aristocratic constitution and institutions built for popular containment and elite control, but an essential factor lies in our antiquated democratic processes. While capitalism may be plagued by market failures and tend towards inequality and oligarchy, it is a far more sophisticated valuation mechanism. Voters only elect their representatives at discrete intervals, through primitive ballots which inherently polarize politics into binary extremes, but consumers and investors vote with their dollars every day on an infinitely sensitive scale.</p>

            <p>To me, all this means it's time to upgrade our democracy at the local, state, federal, and global level. Whether through approval voting, ranked choice voting, score voting, single transferable voting, liquid democracy, national referenda, or a combination thereof, we can build systems designed to empower voters and improve accountability.</p>

            <h2>An Invitation</h2>

            <p>I look forward to exploring these ideas further on this platform. I know I don't have all the answers—in fact, I doubt there are any objective answers. Instead, there are tradeoffs between competing values, and questions of judgment which can best be weighed through deliberation. My greatest hope is that I can cultivate a space for those kinds of discussions—for thinking in public—on my website, on substack, and possibly on other forums in the future.</p>

            <p>If any of this resonates with you—whether you're in St. Louis or working on reform elsewhere—I'd love to hear from you. Reach out via email at <a href="mailto:nahuel.s.fefer@gmail.com">nahuel.s.fefer@gmail.com</a>, or subscribe below to follow along. A better world is possible, but it's going to take an unprecedented degree of collaboration—let's build it together.</p>
